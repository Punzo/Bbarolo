Troubleshooting
###############

I will try to write a troubleshooting page while I receive the feedback from BBarolo's users. 

In the meanwhile, please report any bug or problem you have with BBarolo and pyBBarolo. 
If you are a Github user, you can submit an issue ticket at `this page <https://github.com/editeodoro/bbarolo/issues>`_. Otherwise you can `mail me <enrico.diteodoro@anu.edu.au>`_. Please attach any significant error messages and tell me how to reproduce the problem. 

I will try to fix the issues as soon as I can. Thank you.
